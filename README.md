## 📦 Tech Scope (High Level)

- Core Go language fundamentals
- Modern Go concurrency
- Backend network services
- Observability and debugging
- Performance engineering
- gRPC / distributed systems
- Modern tooling / linting / testing

---

## 🔥 Learning Topics

### Core Language
- modules, packages, workspaces
- interfaces, embedding, composition
- generics (Go 1.22+)

### Concurrency & Distributed
- goroutines, channels
- sync primitives
- worker pools & pipelines
- fan-in/fan-out flows
- context propagation

### Backend Services
- net/http internals
- middleware architectures
- graceful shutdown
- timeouts & cancellation
- gRPC + protobuf

### Observability
- structured logging
- metrics (prometheus)
- distributed tracing
- OpenTelemetry foundations

### Tooling & Performance
- go vet, go fmt, golangci-lint
- unit tests + benchmarks
- pprof, CPU/memory/block profiling
